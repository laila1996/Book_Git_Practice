FAQ Git Day 1

Some of the most common questions from day 1:

1) I don't see .idea, out, or iml file
    it's fine, everything is still going to work the same. Most likely the settings for your project are not showing those files. You can still add them as files to ignore in the gitignore file (just because you don't see them doesn't mean you can't ignore them from being tracked)

    If you wanted to change the view settings in intelliJ
    Click the gear next to the project name
    Select Tree Appearance
    Select Show Excluded file

2) You enabled git in your java project
    In intellij open the settings
    Click version control menu
    Click Directory mappings
    Click the defined project
    Click the minus sign to remove
    -> Also you can go into the folder structure and delete the .git folder

3) The files have different colors after enabling git
    colors are all normal
    red: files are untracked
    green: files are tracked
    blue: files are commit
    yellow: files are ignored from tracking

4) I have .idea or others in gitignore but they are still on github
    This means the files were being tracked already, before they were added to the gitignore. Its not a big deal at the moment, we are just getting started with git. When we learn commands we can also learn how to untrack files

5) How to get project from intelliJ to your computer
    cloning. It will be in next class

6) Unsupported git version
    Most git versions will work, but it cannot be lower than 2.17 version. If you are getting this issue you will need to install a newer version of git as demonstrated in short videos

7) Enable to push to github
    double check your account settings. The account you set up in intelliJ should match the github account you are pushing to

8) It shows me error when committing and has option to commit anyway
    IntelliJ is being smart, it is detecting some possible issues in the code and giving a warning, so before tracking those files it is verifying if a file with possible problems should really be commit
